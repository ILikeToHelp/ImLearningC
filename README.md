# ImLearningC

In this repository I'm presenting solutions to exercises set out in the book commonly known as "K&R". 
I also write out all of the "example" programs, which oft than not are prerequisites to the exercises. They might not be line by line exactly identical, since I don't copy them, but they should have the same functionality. For example, the variable names might differ.

There is also the "My Library" directory, where I put the most recent, most useful versions of certain programs. For example, the "atoi" function which is re-written and set out as a task to be re-written multiple times, is going to be in the most recent version - which uses recursion - in the "My Library" directory. 
The folder will also contain some non-book related programs which I write out of curiosity, boredom or for fun. Though not based on the book exercises or examples those programs will most likely re-enforce the topics introduced by the book.

Hope everything you find here will be useful, and if you know a more optimized solution or you've spotted a mistake, please let me know!

P.S.
All code should be commented in such manner that allows everybody to read the code and makes sense out of it. If **any** part of the program seems unclear/and or the comments are lacking, please report this!
